SNHU Portfolio for Emerging Sys Arch &amp; Tech

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

In pwmled2 the project goal was to blink LED lights. Code Composer Studio was used to program the TC CC3220x LAUNCHXL to blink LED's. Timing the blinking lights is a way to indicate error in the absence of other communication methods. Indicator lights, timing and knowing how to control an LED for patterns is a great way to program a diagnostic tool.  

What did you do particularly well?

I excelled at understanding duty cycles quickly and understanding the goal of the project.

Where could you improve?

I can improve by thinking less about the size and complexity of a project and more on the reason for the goal and the problem it will solve.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

Although I have not added any resources recently, I lean on the support of libraries, forums, and places like github to gather information and diverse opinions about any particular topic.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

Learning to program microcontrollers and become more familiar with drivers, hardware, and C language will be particularly useful for the future in my personal as well as academic goals.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

This project was fairly simple code and straight forward. I used functions that can be reused and are simply maintained.






Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

GPIOinterrupt.c was created to make a prototype of a thermostat for SysTec. The thermostat had to read the room temperature, detect button pushes, and simulate sending data to a server on a timed schedule.

What did you do particularly well?
I believe I did particular well learning about peripherals and microcontrollers as a whole. I did multiple deep dives into types of microcontrollers, peripherals and options available from manufacturers and how they are used in the world. 

Where could you improve?
I can improve by not agonizing over details. Many times, instructions seem very vague to me and I tend to overanalyze them, resulting in overengineering the projects. This has resulted in other projects coming with feedback as "being over complicated".

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
The resources added during this project included navigating data sheets for multiple types of microcontrollers and the websites of chip and board manufacturers.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
Coding in C and for embedded systems will be particularly useful for other coursework and also personal projects.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Using functions, consistent form and structure and consisten naming conventions made the code easy to maintain and read.
